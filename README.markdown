# Spectacle Boilerplate

## Reference

The Spectacle core API is available at [https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.md).

## Development

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open terminal and run `yarn`. (or `npm install` if you're about that life)

Next, run `rm -R .git` to remove the existing version control.

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`
